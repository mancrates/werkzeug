"""When it comes to combining multiple controller or view functions
(however you want to call them) you need a dispatcher. A simple way
would be applying regular expression tests on the ``PATH_INFO`` and
calling registered callback functions that return the value then.

This module implements a much more powerful system than simple regular
expression matching because it can also convert values in the URLs and
build URLs.

Here a simple example that creates a URL map for an application with
two subdomains (www and kb) and some URL rules:

.. code-block:: python

    m = Map([
        # Static URLs
        Rule('/', endpoint='static/index'),
        Rule('/about', endpoint='static/about'),
        Rule('/help', endpoint='static/help'),
        # Knowledge Base
        Subdomain('kb', [
            Rule('/', endpoint='kb/index'),
            Rule('/browse/', endpoint='kb/browse'),
            Rule('/browse/<int:id>/', endpoint='kb/browse'),
            Rule('/browse/<int:id>/<int:page>', endpoint='kb/browse')
        ])
    ], default_subdomain='www')

If the application doesn't use subdomains it's perfectly fine to not set
the default subdomain and not use the `Subdomain` rule factory. The
endpoint in the rules can be anything, for example import paths or
unique identifiers. The WSGI application can use those endpoints to get the
handler for that URL.  It doesn't have to be a string at all but it's
recommended.

Now it's possible to create a URL adapter for one of the subdomains and
build URLs:

.. code-block:: python

    c = m.bind('example.com')

    c.build("kb/browse", dict(id=42))
    'http://kb.example.com/browse/42/'

    c.build("kb/browse", dict())
    'http://kb.example.com/browse/'

    c.build("kb/browse", dict(id=42, page=3))
    'http://kb.example.com/browse/42/3'

    c.build("static/about")
    '/about'

    c.build("static/index", force_external=True)
    'http://www.example.com/'

    c = m.bind('example.com', subdomain='kb')

    c.build("static/about")
    'http://www.example.com/about'

The first argument to bind is the server name *without* the subdomain.
Per default it will assume that the script is mounted on the root, but
often that's not the case so you can provide the real mount point as
second argument:

.. code-block:: python

    c = m.bind('example.com', '/applications/example')

The third argument can be the subdomain, if not given the default
subdomain is used.  For more details about binding have a look at the
documentation of the `MapAdapter`.

And here is how you can match URLs:

.. code-block:: python

    c = m.bind('example.com')

    c.match("/")
    ('static/index', {})

    c.match("/about")
    ('static/about', {})

    c = m.bind('example.com', '/', 'kb')

    c.match("/")
    ('kb/index', {})

    c.match("/browse/42/23")
    ('kb/browse', {'id': 42, 'page': 23})

If matching fails you get a ``NotFound`` exception, if the rule thinks
it's a good idea to redirect (for example because the URL was defined
to have a slash at the end but the request was missing that slash) it
will raise a ``RequestRedirect`` exception. Both are subclasses of
``HTTPException`` so you can use those errors as responses in the
application.

If matching succeeded but the URL rule was incompatible to the given
method (for example there were only rules for ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` but
routing tried to match a ``POST`` request) a ``MethodNotAllowed``
exception is raised.
